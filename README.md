# ECCO Dataset

**Ecological, Cultural, and Climatic Origins (ECCO) Dataset**

This repository contains five supplementary datasets (S1â€“S5) accompanying the study:

> *Drivers of immune-related genetic variation across human populations*

Each file corresponds to a distinct predictor potentially influencing the emergence of human infectious diseases, the establishment and transmission of infectious agents, and the distribution, intensity, and dynamics of pathogens across the 54 populations of the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset contents

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **DatasetS1.csv** | Area under the curve (AUC) of sociopolitical complexity trajectories across the 54 HGDP populations. |
| **DatasetS2.csv** | Ages of the onset of the Neolithic revolution and urbanization across the 54 HGDP populations. |
| **DatasetS3.csv** | Ages of the oldest domestication events across the 54 HGDP populations. |
| **DatasetS4.csv** | Pre-industrial pathogen stress across the 54 HGDP populations. |
| **DatasetS5.csv** | Comprehensive set of historical, cultural, ecological, and climatic predictors compiled to explain variation in immune-related genomic signatures across the 54 HGDP populations.  |
