# ECCO Dataset

**Ecological, Cultural, and Climatic Origins (ECCO) Dataset**

This repository contains five supplementary datasets (S1â€“S5) accompanying the study:

> *Time lag between Neolithic and urbanization drives immune-related genetic variation across human populations.*

Each dataset corresponds to a distinct layer of information integrated for 54 global populations from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), linking immune-related genomic signatures (especially in the MHC region) with cultural, ecological, and climatic factors.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset contents

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **DatasetS1.csv** | Comprehensive set of historical, cultural, ecological, and climatic predictors compiled to explain variation in immune-related genomic signatures across 54 HGDP populations. |
| **DatasetS2.csv** | Metadata and sources used to calculate the Î±-index, representing long-term exposure to domesticated animals through time. |
| **DatasetS3.csv** | Ages of the onset of the Neolithic Revolution and urbanization for each HGDP population, including bibliographic sources. |
| **DatasetS4.csv** | Sociopolitical complexity values derived from the area under the curve (AUC) of PC1 from Turchin *et al.* (2017), matched to each HGDP population. |
| **DatasetS5.csv** | Detailed codebook and methodological notes describing variables, definitions, and data sources used in the analyses. |
