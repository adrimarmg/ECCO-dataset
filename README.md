# ECCO Dataset

**Ecological, Cultural, and Climatic Origins (ECCO) Dataset**

This repository contains five supplementary datasets (S1â€“S5) accompanying the study:

> *Drivers of immune-related genetic variation across human populations*

Each file corresponds to a distinct predictor potentially influencing the emergence of human infectious diseases, the establishment and transmission of infectious agents, and the distribution, intensity, and dynamics of pathogens across the 54 populations of the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP).

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset contents

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **DatasetS1.csv** | Comprehensive set of historical, cultural, ecological, and climatic predictors compiled to explain variation in immune-related genomic signatures across 54 HGDP populations. |
| **DatasetS2.csv** | Metadata and sources used to calculate the Î±-index, representing long-term exposure to domesticated animals through time. |
| **DatasetS3.csv** | Ages of the onset of the Neolithic Revolution and urbanization for each HGDP population, including bibliographic sources. |
| **DatasetS4.csv** | Sociopolitical complexity values derived from the area under the curve (AUC) of PC1 from Turchin *et al.* (2017), matched to each HGDP population. |
| **DatasetS5.csv** | Detailed codebook and methodological notes describing variables, definitions, and data sources used in the analyses. |
